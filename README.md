#Creating Musical Variations with Chaotic Attractors

##Venkatesh. S

This is a mini project I did for a Computational Physics course. The final piece of code I submitted in my report is the script Code/Final_code.py. I played around with [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21) a lot before I figured out how to make things work. These code snippets are in the folder playing_with_music21. I made a short presentation in class and the files related to this are in the presentation folder. Finally the report that I submitted along with the .bib file and the .md file and related images are all in the report folder. The final report is in report/venkatesh_report.pdf.

*If you want to start playing around*, start with the code in the Code folder.
